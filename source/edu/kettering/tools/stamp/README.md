Stamp Tool
==========

This tool will be designed to take in a binary image and allow the user to stamp its shape (black pixels are considered part of the shape) wherever they click in the canvas. Additionally, the user will be able to specify the color of the stamp. In effect, this allows the user to create custom shapes that they can repeatedly stamp across their creations.
